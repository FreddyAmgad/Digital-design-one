This project is essentially a smart calculator brought to life with the help of Verilog, a special language for describing hardware, and an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) platform. Think of it as a high-tech version of a calculator you'd find on your phone or computer, but with a twistâ€”it's designed to perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using hardware circuits instead of software. This means it can crunch numbers super fast and with great precision. It's like having a tiny, lightning-fast math whiz at your fingertips! Plus, by combining hardware and software in this way, the project shows how technology can come together to create something incredibly useful and efficient for everyday tasks.
